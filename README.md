**"Eat your greens and stay smart!"**

## Description

Leverage the power of Celery and SmolAgents in this Python project. Build scalable, distributed workflows with intelligent agents that handle tasks efficiently and asynchronously.

This project provides a powerful foundation for building scalable, asynchronous systems by combining:

*   **Celery:** For reliable task queuing and management.
*   **SmolAgents:** For creating intelligent, autonomous agents to perform tasks.
*   **Python:** The flexible language that ties everything together.

## Features

*   [Feature 1 - e.g., Asynchronous task processing with Celery]
*   [Feature 2 - e.g., Creation of custom SmolAgents with flexible configurations]
*   [Feature 3 - e.g., Scalable architecture for handling large volumes of tasks]
*   [Feature 4 - e.g., Easy integration with various message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis)]
*   [Feature 5 - e.g., Customizable agent workflows and task pipelines]
*   [Feature 6 - e.g., Optional integrations with other libraries/services]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10 or higher
*   [Specify required Celery version, e.g., Celery 5.2+]
*   [Specify required Redis or RabbitMQ version, e.g., Redis 6.0 or RabbitMQ 3.8+]
*   pip package manager

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone /github.com/rpfilomeno/kintsay
    cd kintsay
    ```

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Broker Setup:**
    *   Choose a message broker (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ).
      ```python
      #Example config in settings.py
      BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
      CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
      ```
2. **Celery Configuration:**
   ```python
   #TODO
   ```

3.  **SmolAgents Setup:**

   ```python
   # TODO
   ```

### Running the Project

1.  **Start the Celery worker:**
    ```bash
    celery -A kitsay.celery worker --loglevel=info
    ```

 
2.  **Run the Python application:**
   ```python
   #TODO
   ```

## Usage

*   How to define a Celery task and trigger it asynchronously.
